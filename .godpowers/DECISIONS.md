# Decisions

Append-only. Newest last. To change a decision, add an entry that supersedes it.

## 2026-09-26: Move to the Godpowers 7 layout
Context: Godpowers 7 keeps one state file, a plan, this decision log, and an evidence ledger.
Decision: Archived the 6.x files under `.godpowers/archive/v6/`.
Why: Less state to keep in sync; gates are enforced by code instead of instructions.
